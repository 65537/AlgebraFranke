# AlgebraFranke
In this repository we collect our notes on some algebra lectures taught by Professor Jens Franke at the Universiät (university) Bonn. The notes began with the lecture Algebra I in the summer semester of 2017. This lecture builds on the lectures Lineare Algebra (linear algebra) I&II and Einführung in die Algebra (introduction to algebra) also taught by Professor Franke in the preceding semesters. 

While the notes began as simple lecture notes taken with LaTeX (because any handwritten notes I take sooner or later become totally chaotic) we enjoy the positive reception they receive by our fellow students.
